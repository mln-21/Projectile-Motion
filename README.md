# Projectile-Motion
A simulation of idealized projectile motions in Python using kinematics
This is an ongoing project. There may be a bug with the tspan where if it is not long enough and does nto hit the ground then the simulation breaks, I will fix this when I have time and 
will add quadratic and linear drag with coefficents that can be changed.
Right now it is based on newtonian kinematics assuking an idealized space

If you are coming from my resume, please send me an email if you are further interested in the code and want to play around with it.
